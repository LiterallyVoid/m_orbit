# Orbital mechanics library

This library would not have been possible without <https://orbital-mechanics.space/>.

This library is NOT production ready. It is NOT hobby ready. It is NOT numerically safe. It WILL ruin your day.

About the only part of this library I trust are circular orbits. Nothing else will work. Do not expect anything else to work. Do not use this code unless you are capable of rewriting it, and in that case, rewrite it. It will be better.

**You have been warned.**
